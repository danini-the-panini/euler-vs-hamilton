Euler vs Hamilton
=================

Round 1 - Fight!

An investigation on the differences in numerical stability between the use of Euler angles and Hamilton quaternions for rotation

How to compile this, you say?
-----------------------------

This project is also an experiment to see if I can get something done by literate programming. So in order to compile this you need [WEBdown](https://github.com/jellymann/WEBdown) to convert the *.C.wd to *.C files.
