\section{Introduction}

Rotation --- or rather the \emph{representation} of rotation --- in three-dimensional affine space is surprisingly difficult.
There are many different ways to represent these rotations, e.g. Euler-angle, axis-angle, rotation matrices, or unit quaternion parameterizations.
Of these examples, the Euler-angle system is the most villified, while the unit quaternion parameterization is often said to be superior.
Quaternions solve the gimbal lock problems that Euler-angle systems experience, and are said to be more numerically stable.
It has also been claimed that Quaternions are a more efficient method of calculating rotations.
We have no reason to doubt these claims, in fact they seem sensible to us.
However, we question the conclusion that all animation systems should use quaternions as a parameterization of their rotations.
In this paper we will specifically look at the special case of an interactive three dimensional camera with three degrees of freedom (pitch, roll and yaw) in order to see whether the claims that quaternions are superior can be empirically supported.
These claims are that Quaternions do not suffer from gimbal lock; are more numerically stable than other approaches; and more performant.
To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no research papers that publish empirically derived figures supporting these claims.
It is important to have access to such figures, however, since what is true in theory may not hold up in practise once implemented on a real computer system ---
especially due to factors such as the numerical instability that is introduced by the inaccurate floating point mathematics as implemented for computers, or the fact that graphics cards and their drivers may have hidden performance cliffs and undocumented behaviour.
We have also been unable to find any discussion in the literature about which parameterization to use for floating cameras with three degrees of freedom.
The contribution of this paper is then a conclusion as to this best possible parameterization and the provision of empirical figures to back up various claims.

\section{Parameterizations}

Several parameterizations of rotations in three dimensions have already been proposed.
We recapitulate some of them here, for the uninitaited reader.

\subsection{Euler-Angle}

The Euler-angle system is a parameterization based on three separate angles: roll, pitch and yaw --- these are the rotation amounts around three separate axes: the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively \parencite[11]{diebel06}.
The problem with this system is one of gimball lock.
Briefly stated, a rotation of one of the axes can bring it into the plane of one of the other axes.
At this stage, a rotation about any one of these two axes is equivalent to a rotation about the other, we have therefore lost a degree of freedom \parencite[4]{pletinckx89}.

\subsection{Axis-Angle}

The axis-angle representation collapses all rotations to a rotation with a certain magnitude about a single axis.
The magnitude of this rotation becomes the length of a vector with a direction that corresponds to this axis \parencite[18]{diebel06}.

\subsection{Rotation Matrices}

Rotation matrices represent rotations as the components of a $3 \times 3$ matrix of real vlaues.
Rotation matrices are convenient because they work well with the well-established method of using matrices to represent affine transformations in computer graphics applications.
Rotation matrices have to be kept ortho-normal, if they deviate from this property then they will alter the length of vectors, leading to distortions in the shape of the objects being rotated \parencite[4--5]{diebel06}.
